# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ‚ùå "API key not valid" Error

**Problem**: Getting "API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key" when clicking "Refresh Data"

**Solution**: This has been fixed! The app now uses OAuth authentication only and doesn't require an API key.

**Steps to fix**:

1. Make sure you're using the latest code
2. Your `.env` file should only contain:
    ```
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
    ```
3. Remove any `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` line if present
4. Restart the dev server: `pnpm dev`
5. Log out and log back in

### ‚ùå "No events found"

**Problem**: Dashboard shows "No events found" even though you have calendar events

**Possible causes and solutions**:

1. **Calendar names don't match**
    - ‚úÖ Ensure you have calendars containing "Work", "Class", or "Study" in their names
    - The search is case-insensitive, so "work", "Work", "WORK" all work

2. **Date range doesn't include events**
    - ‚úÖ Check the date range picker
    - Try expanding the date range
    - The app auto-detects semester, but your events might be outside this range

3. **Calendar permissions not granted**
    - ‚úÖ When you logged in, you need to grant calendar read permissions
    - Try logging out and logging in again
    - Check the browser console for permission errors

### ‚ùå Login/Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Can't log in or authentication fails

**Solutions**:

1. **Check your Client ID**

    ```bash
    # Make sure .env has the correct Client ID
    cat .env
    ```

2. **Verify Google Cloud Console settings**
    - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    - APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
    - Check your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
    - Authorized JavaScript origins should include: `http://localhost:5173`
    - Authorized redirect URIs should include: `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Clear browser cache**
    - Open DevTools (F12)
    - Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear site data
    - Try logging in again

4. **Try incognito mode**
    - This helps rule out cookie/cache issues

    - Make sure it's enabled (should show a green checkmark)

### ‚ùå Events not categorizing correctly

**Problem**: Events are going into wrong categories or showing as "Other"

**Solutions**:

1. **Check event names**
    - Events are categorized by keywords in their names
    - Make sure event names include keywords like:
        - Work: SITCON, Coding, Meeting, etc.
        - Study: Calculus, Homework, Linear Algebra, etc.
        - Life: GYM, Exercise, etc.

2. **Add custom keywords**
    - Edit `src/utils/dataAnalysis.ts`
    - Add your keywords to the `categoryMapping` object

    ```typescript
    export const categoryMapping: CategoryMapping = {
    	Work: ["sitcon", "meeting", "project"], // Add yours
    	Study: ["calculus", "homework"],
    	Life: ["gym", "yoga"]
    };
    ```

3. **Use calendar types**
    - Events from "Class" or "Study" calendars default to Study category
    - Events from "Work" calendar default to Work category

### ‚ùå Charts not showing / Loading forever

**Problem**: Dashboard loads but charts don't appear or keep loading

**Solutions**:

1. **Check if events loaded**
    - Open browser DevTools (F12)
    - Console tab
    - Look for "No events found" or API errors

2. **Date range issues**
    - Make sure you have events in the selected date range
    - Try manually selecting a wider date range

3. **Browser compatibility**
    - Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
    - Make sure JavaScript is enabled

**Problem**: Build or dev server errors

**Solutions**:

1. **Clean install**

    rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
    pnpm install
    ```

2. **Check Node version**

    ```bash
    node --version  # Should be 18+
    ```

3. **Port already in use**
    ```bash
    # If port 5173 is already in use
    pnpm dev --port 5174
    ```
